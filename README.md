## What is SteemitEva?
Evaluation optimized for everyones needs. By using SteemitEva you can evaluate any post and comment of Steemit. Getting the data via Steemit JavaScript API, SteemitEva gives you the possibilities to choose, which data should be shown. Use it for selecting the winners of a challenge or a draw you started on Steemit.

## How to use?
On the site [http://steemiteva.cteipen.de](http://steemiteva.cteipen.de) you can start evaluating steemit content. By clicking on the settings-button in the top-left corner, you can select which data the evaluation should include.

The table being displayed after the evaluation can be modified according to your needs too. For that, use the toolbar on top of the table. The functions will be implemented step-by-step. An additional tutorial will follow soon.

## Thank you!
[@detlev](https://steemit.com/@detlev) is a steemit user. He provides a challenge about the most delicious drink in the world: beer. With the tag #BeerSaturday he creates every week new post for other users to take part at this challenge. As an effect of this challenge he spent much time on evaltuating the results. So he asks me to develop a tool for this. That moment was the birth of SteemitEva.
